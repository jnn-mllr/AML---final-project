# AML---final-project
final project for Applied Machine Learning for the Adult Data Set
# Income Prediction Using Categorical Data

## Project Overview

This project predicts whether an individual earns more than \$50,000/year using demographic and employment attributes from the UCI Adult Income dataset. Since most features are categorical, we explore how different encoding strategies impact both performance and interpretability in linear models.

We compare **one-hot, ordinal, frequency, and target encoding (with cross-validation leakage control)** and implement custom machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression) from scratch, fully integrated into a modular pipeline.

## ðŸ“Š Encoding Strategies
| Encoding    | Description                                                     | Use Case                            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| One-hot     | Convert each category to separate binary columns                | Nominal features                    |
| Ordinal     | Map ordered categories to integers                              | Ordered features (e.g. education)   |
| Frequency   | Replace category with frequency in training set                 | High-cardinality features           |
| Target (CV) | Replace category with mean target, computed using CV for safety | Powerful, leakage-prone if careless |


## Results

| Encoding     | Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|--------------|------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| One-hot      | Logistic (base)        | 0.11     | 0.11      | 0.11   |
| Ordinal      | Logistic (ridge)       | 0.11     | 0.11      | 0.11   |
| Target (CV)  | Logistic (tuned)       | 0.11     | 0.11      | 0.11   |


## ðŸ§ª Models & Evaluation

    Logistic Regression (no/weak/strong ridge/lasso regularization)

    Training method: Batch Gradient Descent

    Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

    Leakage prevention: Target encoding only uses out-of-fold statistics

    Scaling: StandardScaler applied to numeric columns

## ðŸ“Œ Best Model (TO FILL)

    Type: Logistic Regression

    Penalty: TO_FILL (none / ridge / lasso)

    Î»: TO_FILL

    Accuracy: TO_FILL

    Precision: TO_FILL

    Recall: TO_FILL
